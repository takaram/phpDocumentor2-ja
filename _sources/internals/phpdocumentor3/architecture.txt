Architecture
============

Introduction
------------

phpDocumentor's architecture is best described as a Hexagonal Architecture where the core domain is modeled according
to Domain Driven Design principles.

Prerequisites

Layers
------

phpDocumentor is divided into three basic layers:

1. Infrastructure
2. Application
3. Domain Model
